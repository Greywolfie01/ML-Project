    "- **`train.csv`**: Contains personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`test.csv`**: Holds personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data. The task is to predict the value of `Transported` for these passengers.\n",

    "- **`PassengerId`**: A unique Id for each passenger, formatted as `gggg_pp` where `gggg` indicates a group the passenger is traveling with, and `pp` is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`HomePlanet`**: The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`Cabin`**: The cabin number where the passenger is staying, formatted as `deck/num/side`, where `side` can be either `P` for Port or `S` for Starboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Destination`**: The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Specific to `train.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Transported`**: Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target column for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific to `sample_submission.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains two columns:\n",
    "    - **`PassengerId`**: Id for each passenger in the test set.\n",
    "    - **`Transported`**: The target prediction for each passenger, either `True` or `False`.\n"
