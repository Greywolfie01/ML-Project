    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "By the year 2912, interstellar voyages have become a commonplace component of human civilization, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for the field of advanced data science. It was against this backdrop that a critical situation emerged involving the Spaceship Titanic, a pioneering interstellar passenger vessel. Launched just a month prior, this vessel was transporting approximately 13,000 individuals to start anew on one of three terraformed exoplanets within the neighboring stellar systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the journey was marred by a catastrophic event as the vessel neared Alpha Centauri, heading towards the temperate exoplanet 55 Cancri E. The Spaceship Titanic encountered an undetected spacetime anomaly hidden within an interstellar dust cloud. Echoing the tragic fate of its namesake from a millennium ago, the vessel remained structurally intact, yet a significant portion of its passengers were instantaneously transported to an alternate dimension [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the datasets recovered from the ship's compromised data systems to ascertain which passengers were affected by the anomaly and thus displaced from their original dimension. The successful identification of these individuals is imperative for the coordination of a rescue operation and holds the potential to prevent a disaster of historical magnitude.\n",
    "The goal is to unlock the solution to this cosmic enigma, offering relief and hope to the myriad lives in anticipation of news regarding their displaced kin.\n",
